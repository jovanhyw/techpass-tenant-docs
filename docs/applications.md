# Client Applications

## Overview
Client applications or application (or simply apps) are namespace objects that represent a single tenant service that is integrated with TechPass AAD. Apps describes the tenant service to TechPass AAD and contains properties that define how TechPass AAD should interact with them.

## Properties
?> Some of these properties will only appear after the Client App has been created.

### Application ID
The ID of the App. This is used to identify your tenant service to TechPass AAD during a HTTP request.

### Directory ID
The directory ID of TechPass AAD tenant with Microsoft's Azure AD SaaS. This allows the authentication endpoints to identify that the requests should be directed to TechPass AAD.

### Common Endpoints
This drawer popup contains the URLs for needed for using the Auth Code grant and Implicit Grant flows. Remember to replace the values in square brackets.

### Owners

### Logout URL
You can specify a URL to redirect your users to after they have successfully logged out from your app.

### Redirect URL(s)*
After successfully authenticating your users, you will want your users to be redirected by to your app. You will need to provide one or more valid URLs to redirect your user to. This should be a user routable URL.

TechPass AAD will validate the `redirect_uri` parameter in all authorize HTTP requests for the app. If the value of the parameter does not match any of the URLs in this list. The authorisation request will fail.

- To add more URLs, click on '*+ Add URL*' and enter the URL in the new text field that appears.
- To remove an existing URL, just click on the thrash bin on the right of the URL that you want to remove.
- Remember to click the Update button at the top if you are editing the URLs for an existing app.

### Enable Sign In
Unchecking this field will disable ALL user sign in to the tenant service.

### User Assignment Required
This property determines if a user needs to be granted access before he/she is allowed to sign into your app. Leaving this field uncheck means that **ALL** TechPass users will be able to sign into your app.

Careful consideration is required if you wish the alter the value of this field. Find out more about to how design your [Access Model](resources#concepts) with TechPass.

Unchecking user assignment would make your application accessible to anyone with a TechPass account.

!> If a user's access is **explicitly revoked** from other applications; That user will still **have access** to your application, until it expires due to inactivity.

If you left this field checked, you will need to grant access to users that you want to allow into your app. See [Assigning Access to your App](#assigning-access-to-your-app) for more info.

### Mark As Published
Checking this field will publish your application on TechPass portal.
Leave as unchecked if your app should not be displayed to users e.g. apps for testing etc.

### Implicit Grant
Implicit grant is less secure than other grant flows and disabled by default.

To enable implicit grant, check the corresponding boxes to allow an Access Token or ID Token or both to be issued in an implicit grant flow.

!> If you do not use implicit grant, please keep the boxes unchecked.

?> More information regarding Implicit Grant is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow).

### Client Secrets
The secret key is used by tenant services to authenticate itself to TechPass AAD. Each secret key is only valid for a period of one year once created.

### Assigned Users and Groups
A list of users and/or user groups that has been granted permission to sign in to your tenant service. If you add a user group, ALL users within that group will be granted permission.

However, do take note that this **does not** apply to nested group(s). Only direct users of a group will receive the assigned role permission as app assignments do not cascade to nested group(s).
