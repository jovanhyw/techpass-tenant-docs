# Tenant Namespace
## Overview
Each service that has onboarded to TechPass are called tenants. Tenants get access to features that allow them to configure and consume TechPass services. Each tenant is given a namespace on TechPass. A Namespaces is an isolated environment within TechPass that safeguards your resources/objects from other tenants. 

Only authorized Tenant Administrators get access to a specific project's namespace and other tenant administrators cannot gain access to your namespace unless authorized by you or your co-admins.

As Tenant Admin, you will see a list of Tenant Namespaces that you have been authorized to access on your dashboard.

You will see the Display Name, Description of the namespace and a directory ID. We will touch on directory ID in later sections. You will also see a list of current Tenant Administrators authorised to manage this namespace. 

You can update a namespace's *Display Name* and *Description* here. These information will be useful to help other TechPass users know what your product is about.

## Managing Tenant Admins

## Namespace Objects
As a tenant of TechPass, you are granted access to our many features. You can use these features to create objects to help you:
- integrate your services with TechPass AAD. ([Applications](applications))
- manage your user access and permissions. ([Applications](applications) and [Groups](groups))
- onboard users onto your services. ([Vendors](vendors) and [APIs](apis/integration.md))
- get notified of system events. ([Webhooks](webhooks))

The objects are organized into separate tabs on the left in the *Namespace Overview* screen. As we continue development of TechPass, more features will be made available for you. So keep a look out for new feature releases!
